# Work Planner
### Description
The work planner will be an application that borrows heavily from team foundation server's work flow. This particular work Planner is meant to be used in an academic situation.
### Expectations
The user will be able to build a schedule on a week by week basis. The schedule will be archived once a semester. The user will be able to create projects that they are working on, projects may include classes, jobs, or other overarching time sinks. The user will be able to create work items to represent goals to work toward (e.g. Study for test 2, grade homework 5). The user will be able to create tasks associated with each work item. Tasks are supposed to be small well defined items that the user will be able to complete in an hour or two.
