# Finance Application
### Description
This is supposed to be a light application to manage the accounts and budget of the [Triangle Fraternity at Georgia Tech](https://www.facebook.com/TriangleGT/). This application will be able to take in deposits from members of the fraternity and be able to make charges to the members as well. This application should also allow for the creation of a budget based on events, as well create a tabulated value sheet from actual expenses.  
This application will store data in unencrypted text files, this means that the application will run differently given different .finapp files. Please do not edit the finapp files as this may destroy your data or corrupt account payment history.
### How To
##### Open the Application
run `javac *.java` followed by `java FinanceApp`. This will bring up the GUI window to allow you to interact with the application.
